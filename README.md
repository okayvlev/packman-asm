# Pacman in ASM

This is an incomplete recreation of the famous Pacman game. Some features are not implemented, i.e. fruits and levelling system. There are also minor problems with collision detection and display refresh rate, yet the game is quite playable.

The project was created for learning purposes.

## Build and run

Use `build-dos.bat` to build executable using FASM assembly.

Use `run-dos.bat` to build and run game using your local DOSBox installation.

## Controls

Use arrow keys to control the Pacman.
